Overview
========

* patterns
* flexibility
* creativity

Music and the Brain
===================

* Lots of studies about how the brain/music/creativity correlate
* Pianists have a more symmentrical right-/left-handedness determination, achieved through practice of piano
* Speech and Language processing associated with music education
* IBM and hiring of Music Majors

Catherine
=========

* singing showtunes / jazz-hands
* public school music ed
* Boston U
* Manhattan School of Music
* Professional singer for most of a decade
* Career questions: gigging it was rough, next paycheck, having to do it every day started the fatigue of what she loved.
* Coding education: Flatiron School, worked at Red Antler, and now at Mavenlink

Why the transition?
===================

* Leap of faith, recommended by a friend
* After starting to work in it, liked it
* Did not see the correlation between background and code, then realized it was helping

The learning process
====================

* break it down into pieces
* learn the semantics, in music, learn the scale
* learning what spaces / lines mean, what the note shapes mean, what the rest shapes mean

Learning Patterns
=================

* The biggest connection between music and code
* structural patterns, archetectural patterns
* knowing how to balance dependencies when implementing change

Problem Solving
===============

* Corpus Callosum
* Musicians use almost every part of the brain at once when performing
* Effective, versatile, and rapid problem solving
* Not giving up, covering the same material to understand, resolve, perform, fix, etc.

Growth Mindset
==============

* Fixed Mindset = limited to what you know
* Growth Mindset = capable of growing and learning

Collaboration
=============

* Communicate well, collaborate well, work with a team
* Musician: you learn how to listen, work well with others
* Jazz solo: listen, build upon, give back
* The goal is the same: working with a team to create a product that can be enjoyed by a user/audience

Why?
====

* Don't let untapped resources pass you by
* See the potential in those unknowns (resumes, etc.)
* Diverse backgrounds are an asset
* Music education matters
* Don't be afraid to get into/back into music
