# Opening Panel (Analytics, Automation, and Intelligent Agents)

## APIs and Marketing

  * Balance of human and automation is still somewhat needed
  * Ability to handle large volumes of valid data (and reduce duplicated data)
  * Ability to act on that data in the speed of a page load (or less)

## Intelligent Agents and their ability to see through the noise

  * Need for companies interests to represent the customer
  * Filter the firehose of information
  * Reduce human labor to get to a goal (ed: but what is the healthy balance there?)
  * Fully recorded lives
  * The individual and the other... How do we do that without being inconsiderate or malicious?
  * Hololens + facial recognition + emotional recognition = automated intellect?
  * Gatekeepers/Agents and security around the freedom of information (ask before opening the gates)

## Humans and computers

  * bots against bots for security concerns?
  * ettiquite (don't tag some people, leave things anonymous in some interfaces)
  * option that doesn't exist yet: share your data for pay
  * what do you do when you don't know the norms?
  * conversational ui's: the avg. user has high expectations
  * If you're going to build something, make sure it handles the interactions really well
  * Make choices clear
  * Personality vs. Functionality balance (copywriting detail)
  * How to avoid the creepy factor (people not expecting a bot to act human)
  * Expert systems replace/displace Knowledge Workers, is an intelligent agent (automation) as good at figuring out bug reporting etc.
  * How do we build learning into automation development cycle
  * IBM Watson: tracking and learning from failure scenarios
  * The decision tree conundrum: over-encapsulation and over-simplification of many things when ultimately one action is the desired outcome
  * Clippy for the helpdesk?

## What is the most comment analytical task you do today that you would like to solve tomorrow

  * Automation of basic scientific principles
  * The common questions inside a workspace (HR/IT Automation)
  * Automating collection of specimens, logging, cataloging (Watson detecting rare case of Leukemia)
  * Automating filtering of news, validation of data/information
